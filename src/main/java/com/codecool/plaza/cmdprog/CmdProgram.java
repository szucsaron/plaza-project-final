        The CmdProgram class encapsulates what (cart) and for how much (prices) a user
        bought items in the plaza. (Items and in the cart are matched to prices by their
        index. ) It is also responsible for asking the user for input on what to do next
        (in the run method), so here you need to implement some basic menu system.

        For example when the program starts there is no Plaza instance, so users can
        create one
